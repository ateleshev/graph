Ed
==

A graph library.  For goals of speed and simplicity, Ed uses zero-based
integer node IDs and omits interfaces that would accomodate user data or
user implemented behavior.

To use Ed functions, you typically create a data structure parallel
to your application data, call an Ed function, and use the result to
navigate your application data.

This library is a reaction to other libraries where you adapt your application
data to support library functions, either by implementing interfaces or by
storing application data in library data structures.

The name Ed means nothing.  You could think of it as short for someone’s
name or standing for something but really it’s just short an easy to type.
