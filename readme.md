Another implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

This is a stripped down version of github.com/soniakeys/graph.  It serves
a couple of purposes.  One purpose is understanding the algorithm.
This package has the code in a slightly simpler form that might be a little
easier to figure out.  Another purpose is exploring the overhead of making
the package reusable, memory efficient, and goroutine safe.
